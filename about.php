      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>We’re just people who love to read books! Whether it be for educational purposes or just for the heck of it, sharing our insights and discovering new books is our passion. Even in this digital age, the feeling of opening a new book, and smelling the new book smells forces “our” brain to produce happiness when standing in our shoes. The turn of every page is a brand new, and different adventure for every single reader and that is what we believe to be priceless.

      On a more serious note, not only will your imagination opened but engaging your mind into everyday reading will benefit you from the start. Earl Nightingale once said many years ago that one hour per day of study in your chosen field was all it takes. One hour per day of study will put you at the top of your field within three years. Within five years you’ll be a national authority. In seven years, you can be one of the best people in the world at what you do.</p>
